# Not that much to see here...

The project is in its early stages, which means there's not much of a point to developing mods for it right now, beyond mods meant specifically for testing. 

# Help us make MuonMC

If you were looking to make a mod for such a little modloader, you're probably more interested in what's behind the curtain. We welcome you to join in on MuonMC's development!
