# MuonMC

Muon is a lightweight modding toolchain for Minecraft focused on stability, simplicity, and ease-of-use. It's ideal for modders who want to get simple things done quickly, and for users who want simple things to run quickly.

Forked from the QuiltMC toolchain, Muon focuses only on the essentials, aiming to return to the consistent releases of Fabric, while doing away with the development inefficiencies which have embedded themselves within that project.

# Friendly to developers
